## Acknowledgment

- Hat tip to James for his dedication in running Triathlons, this App will help his

purpose.

## Getting Started

This setup allows for a Node/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via dev server, and the backend

MongoDb will auto-reload independently.

## Installing

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

    - npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in the terminal:

    - npm start

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
